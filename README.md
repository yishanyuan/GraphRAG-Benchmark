### 🏆 Leaderboards
Two domain-specific leaderboards with comprehensive metrics:

**1. GraphRAG-Bench (Novel)**
- Evaluates models on literary/fictional content

**2. GraphRAG-Bench (Medical)**
- Evaluates models on medical/healthcare content

**Evaluation Dimensions:**
- Fact Retrieval (Accuracy, ROUGE-L)
- Complex Reasoning (Accuracy, ROUGE-L)
- Contextual Summarization (Accuracy, Coverage)
- Creative Generation (Accuracy, Factual Score, Coverage)

### 🧩 Task Examples
Four difficulty levels with representative examples:

**Level 1: Fact Retrieval**  
*Example: "Which region of France is Mont St. Michel located?"*

**Level 2: Complex Reasoning**  
*Example: "How did Hinze's agreement with Felicia relate to the perception of England's rulers?"*

**Level 3: Contextual Summarization**  
*Example: "What role does John Curgenven play as a Cornish boatman for visitors exploring this region?"*

**Level 4: Creative Generation**  
*Example: "Retell King Arthur's comparison to John Curgenven as a newspaper article."*
